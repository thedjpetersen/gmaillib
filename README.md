Python module for GMail
===

Simple Python module to interact with Google's mail service GMail. The module
uses Python's included imaplib and smtplib for recieving and sending emails.

The goal of this module is to provide a simple direct interface to GMail.

Usage
---

To initialize an account you do the following

    import gmaillib

    account = gmaillib.account('username', 'password')

To get messages from the inbox just call the use the inbox method

    account.inbox()

To get a range of messages just give the place to start from and how many to fetch

    account.inbox(start=10, amount=100)

This will fetch the 10th to the 110th message

To get the entire contents of the inbox(**note if you have a large inbox this could take a while**)

	account.get_all_messages()

You can also just get the number of messages in the inbox which is less time consuming.
	
	account.get_inbox_count()

To only get the unread messages of the inbox

	account.unread();

To send an email

	account.send(target, subject, message)

Note that the subject and message are optional.


To fetch emails with gmail search syntax. Added support for gmails web search syntax using X-GM-RAW. 

	account.filter('from:foo@bar.com')

Note that, the mailbox selection is set to Inbox(default). https://github.com/shredder12/gmaillib/blob/master/gmaillib.py#L65

Download messages by using download_attachment()
    
    message.download_attachment(location)
